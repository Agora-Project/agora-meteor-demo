  <h1>Agora forum example app</h1>
  <body>
    This page is for testing the Agora forum application. Please keep in mind that this application is in it's infancy,
    and as such has very little security. Do not use a password you are using anywhere else, as it may very
    well be stolen, and do not post anything you are not prepared to see deleted, as database clears will likely be
    common for the foreseeable future. If you wish to report an issue, please do so <a href="https://github.com/Agora-Project/agora-meteor/issues">here</a>.

    <h2>What is Agora?</h2>

    Agora is a new kind of internet forum designed to allow large numbers of people to discuss complicated topics and
    come to meaningful conclusions. It does this by changing the structure of the conversation - instead of a linear
    thread of replies, any post can be in response to any number of other posts, and can have any number of other posts
    in response to it. Thus, discussions can diverge into different threads for all the various details, and converge for
    their conclusions. In a linear thread, this all has to happen in the same place.

    <h3>Instructions for Use</h3>

    <p></p>The forum displays posts in a force directed graph. The red X button closes a post, removing it from view but not
    deleting it. The "Show Connecting Posts" button shows posts that connect to the given post and haven't been displayed yet.
    The reply button adds a new reply to the graph that you can edit and then submit. If you click reply to multiple different
    posts, your post will be connected to all of them. You can also click reply again to make it not be in response to those posts.
    If you want to move posts about, you can click the background to drag the entire graph, or click the titlebar (but not the title!)
    of a post to drag just that post.
