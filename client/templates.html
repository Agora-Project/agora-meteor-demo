  <h1>Agora forum example app</h1>
  <body>
    This page is for testing the Agora forum application. Please keep in mind that this application is in it's infancy,
    and as such has basically no security whatsoever. Do not use a password you are using anywhere else, as it may very
    well be stolen, and do not post anything you are not prepared to see deleted, as database clears will likely be
    common for the foreseeable future. If you wish to report an issue, please do so <a href="https://github.com/Agora-Project/agora-meteor/issues">here</a>.

    <h2>What is Agora?</h2>

    Agora is a new kind of internet forum designed to allow large numbers of people ti discuss complicated topics and
    come to meaningful conclusions. It does this by changing the structure of the conversation - instead of a linear
    thread of replies, any post can be in response to any number of other posts, and can have any number of other posts
    in response to it. Thus, discussions can diverge into different threads for all the various details, and converge for
    their conclusions. In a linear thread, this all has to happen in the same place.

    <h3>Instructions for Use</h3>

    <p></p>The forum displays posts in a force directed graph. Each post has three buttons, red, blue, and green. The red
    button closes a post, removing it from the graph but leaving it in the database. The blue button loads all posts
    connected to it's post, adding them to the graph, and the green button is a toggle to select a post. You can
    select multiple posts this way, then use the + button in the upper right to add a new post connecting to all
    selected posts.
