    <div class="front-page-center">

        This page is for testing the Agora forum application. Please keep in
        mind that this application is in it's infancy,and as such has very
        little security. Do not use a password you are using anywhere else, as
        it may very well be stolen, and do not post anything you are not
        prepared to see deleted, as database clears will likely be common for
        the foreseeable future. If you wish to report an issue or see what
        future developements are planned, please do so
        <a href="https://github.com/Agora-Project/agora-meteor/issues">here</a>.

        <h2 align="center">What is Agora?</h2>

        Agora is a new kind of internet forum designed to allow large numbers of
        people to discuss complicated topics and come to meaningful conclusions.
        It does this by changing the structure of the conversation - instead of
        a linear thread of replies, any post can be in response to any number of
        other posts, and can have any number of other posts in response to it.
        Thus, discussions can diverge into different threads for all the various
        details, and converge for their conclusions. In a linear thread, this
        all has to happen in the same place.

        <h3 align="center">Instructions for Use</h3>

        <p></p>The forum displays posts in a force directed graph. The red X
        button closes a post, removing it from view but not deleting it. The
        "Show Connecting Posts" button shows a list of posts that connect to the
        given post and haven't been displayed yet. The reply button adds a new
        reply to the graph that you can edit and then submit. If you click reply
        to multiple different posts, your post will be connected to all of them.
        You can also click reply again to make it not be in response to those
        posts. If you want to move posts about, you can click the background to
        drag the entire graph, or click the titlebar (but not the title!) of a
        post to drag just that post.

        First and foremost, simply using the forum, reporting bugs, and making
        suggestions for how it might be improved is quite helpful, and is what I
