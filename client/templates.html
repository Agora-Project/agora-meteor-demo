    <h1 align="center">Agora forum example app</h1>
    <div class="front-page-center">

        This page is for testing the Agora forum application. Please keep in
        mind that this application is in it's infancy,and as such has very
        little security. Do not use a password you are using anywhere else, as
        it may very well be stolen, and do not post anything you are not
        prepared to see deleted, as database clears will likely be common for
        the foreseeable future. If you wish to report an issue or see what
        future developements are planned, please do so
        <a href="https://github.com/Agora-Project/agora-meteor/issues">here</a>.

        <h2 align="center">What is Agora?</h2>

        Agora is a new kind of internet forum designed to allow large numbers of
        people to discuss complicated topics and come to meaningful conclusions.
        It does this by changing the structure of the conversation - instead of
        a linear thread of replies, a post can have any number of other posts in
        response to it. Thus, discussions can diverge into different threads for
        all the various details. In a linear thread, this all has to happen in
        the same place.

        <h3 align="center">Instructions for Use</h3>

        <p></p>The forum displays posts in a force directed graph. click and
        drag to pan about the graph, or use the mouse wheel or zoom bar to zoom
        in and out. Once you've zoomed in far enough, you can reply to a post by
        clicking the reply buttons that pop up and then filling out the reply
        box that pops up.
